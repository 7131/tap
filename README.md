# TapJuggler game

This is a juggling game where you tap (or click) the screen to play.
This is something I came up with as an application example of [jmotion](https://github.com/7131/jmotion/) library.
When it comes to the purpose of a juggling simulator library, people tend to think it's only for creating new simulators, but I wanted to show that you can actually create other things with it (and that it makes the work easier).

There are several existing games that deal with juggling, but many of them have strict catch timing that leads to quick failure, or the ball controls are difficult.
TapJuggler is designed to be easy to play, at least at first.
